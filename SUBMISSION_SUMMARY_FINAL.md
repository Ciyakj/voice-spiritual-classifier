- [ ] Test Hinglish question → response → audio
- [ ] README is in root directory
- [ ] .env file has your API keys (or leave blank for demo mode)

### For Video Recording:
- [ ] Show the actual app working (not just code)
- [ ] Use a clear voice (slow down, speak clearly)
- [ ] Let audio playback fully complete
- [ ] Show performance metrics on screen
- [ ] Explain at least one challenge you faced

### What NOT to Include:
- ❌ node_modules/ (will be ignored by .gitignore)

## 📞 Quick Help

**Q: Should I include node_modules?**
A: No! .gitignore will exclude them. Evaluators will run `npm install`

**Q: What if my API key expires?**
A: App has demo mode - will still work with test responses

**Q: Is 5-11 seconds latency okay?**
A: Yes! You explained why (API response times), and it's acceptable for spiritual guidance

**Q: Should I add a login system?**
A: No, it's not required. Focus on core functionality.

**Q: Can I use different API services?**
A: Yes, but explain your choices in README
